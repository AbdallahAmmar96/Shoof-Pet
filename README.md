# Shoof-Pet
it's a service to describe missing pets and help owners to find them 

## Problem 
When pet owners lost there pet, it's hard to find them and search in large area.

## Solution 
Make a platform that helps them published describe their missing pets so they can find them by using pet rewards (brokered/managed by the service), and location data points (GPS) of pet sightings using augmented reality to overlay last-seen pet locations.

### The aims of the platform are:

- users interested in finding pets register on the site
- anyone can see a list of pets missing near to their location
- pet finders can post 'pet found' messages (with mandatory photo proof) and collect rewards on confirmation from pet owners
- users can comment on pet missing entries, offering data points (sighted, area checked with no results, etc)
- mobile device accessibility
